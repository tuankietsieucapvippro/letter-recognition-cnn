# 🔤 Handwritten Letter Recognition with CNN

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to recognize handwritten uppercase letters from **A to Z** (26 classes).  
The model is trained on a grayscale dataset where each image is 28x28 pixels, flattened into a `.csv` file.

---

### 1 🎯 Goal

Build and train a CNN model to classify **handwritten letters (A–Z)** from grayscale images.  
The model learns patterns from thousands of labeled samples and can predict the character in a new input image.

### 2 📦 Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow` (Keras backend)
- `gdown` (for downloading the dataset from Google Drive)
